        Loops are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a
        certain condition or for a specified number of times. Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks, process
        collections of data, and perform iterations over sequences or ranges of values. There are several types of loops
        commonly used in programming:

    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        A for loop is used when you know beforehand how many times you want to repeat a block of code. It typically
        consists of an initialization step, a condition, and an iteration step. The loop continues to execute as long as
        the condition is true.

        A while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The
        condition is evaluated before each iteration.
