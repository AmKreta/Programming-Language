    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Conditional statements, also known as conditional statements or conditional expressions, are fundamental
        constructs in programming languages. They allow you to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based
        on whether a certain condition is true or false. Conditional statements provide the ability to control the flow
        of a program, making it possible to create dynamic and responsive code.

    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        The if-else statement is a fundamental control structure in programming. It allows you to make decisions in your
        code based on certain conditions. Here's how it works:

    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        The if statement is used to evaluate a condition. If the condition is true, the code block associated with the
        if statement is executed.

    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        The else statement is optional. If the condition in the if statement is false, the code block associated with
        the else statement is executed.

        The conditional operator, often called the ternary operator, is a concise way to write if-else statements in a
