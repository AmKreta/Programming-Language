        Operators in Token programming language are symbols or keywords that are used to perform various operations on
        variables and
        values. Token programming language supports different types of operators, including unary, binary, and ternary
        operators, each
        serving specific purposes.

    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Unary Operator</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        A unary operator is an operator that operates on a single operand, which means it works with only one value.
        Unary operators are used to perform various operations like negation, increment, or type conversion on a single
        operand. Examples include the unary plus +, unary minus -, logical NOT !, and bitwise NOT ~ operators.

    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Binary Operator</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        A binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands, which means it works with two values. Binary
        operators are used to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison between two
        values. Examples include arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and relational operators like <,>, and ==.

    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Ternary Operator</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        A ternary operator is a conditional operator that takes three operands. It is used for making decisions in code
        based on a condition. The ternary operator evaluates a condition and returns one of two values depending on
        whether the condition is true or false. It is written in the form <code>condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false.</code>
        The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional expressions.

    Operators are fundamental in Token programming language for performing various operations and making decisions in
    your code.
    Understanding how to use them correctly is crucial for writing effective and efficient Token programming language
    programs.
