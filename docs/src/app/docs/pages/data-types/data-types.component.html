    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Data types are fundamental concepts in programming that define the type of data a variable can hold. They
        determine how data is stored, manipulated, and processed in a program. In this article, we'll explore some
        common data types and their usage in various programming languages.

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Number</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        The number data type is used to represent numeric values. It includes both integers (whole numbers) and
        floating-point numbers (numbers with a decimal point). Here's how you can declare and use numbers in Token
        Programming Language:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="numberExample.codeSnippet"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">String</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Strings are used to represent text or character data. They are typically enclosed in single ('') or double ("")
        quotes. Here's an example:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="stringExample.codeSnippet"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Array</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Arrays are used to store collections of values, typically of the same data type. They are indexed, and you can
        access elements by their position. Here's an array:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="arrayExample.codeSnippet"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Map (Objects)</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        In Token programming language, objects act as maps or dictionaries that store key-value pairs. Keys are used to
        access values. Let's create a map:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="mapExample.codeSnippet"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Custom Data Types</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        In addition to built-in data types, you can create custom data types using classes or functions. These allow you
        to define complex structures with your own rules and behaviors. Let's create a custom data type using a class:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="customDataTypeExample.codeSnippet"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<app-typography variant="subtitle1">
    Understanding data types is crucial for effective programming. Whether you're working with numbers, strings, maps,
    arrays, or custom data types, choosing the right data type for your variables is essential for proper data
    manipulation and program execution.

    As you become more proficient in programming, you'll discover the power of data types in shaping the behavior of
    your code.
