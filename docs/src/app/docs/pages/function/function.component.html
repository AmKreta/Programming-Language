    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Functions in programming are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task or set of tasks. They are a
        fundamental concept in most programming languages, including the Token Programming Language.
    </app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Here are some key concepts related to functions:

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Function Declaration:</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        A function declaration is a named block of code that can be called and executed. It typically consists of a
        name, a list of parameters (if any), a function body, and optionally, a return statement. For example:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionDeclerationExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Function Expression:</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        A function expression is similar to a function declaration but is defined as part of an expression. It can be
        assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions. For example:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionExpressionExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Function Call:</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Invoking or executing a function is called a function call. This is done by using the function name followed by
        parentheses, optionally passing arguments within the parentheses. For example:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionCallExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Parameters</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Parameters are variables that are declared as part of a function's signature. They act as placeholders for
        values that are passed when the function is called. For example, a and b in the add function above are
        parameters.
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionParametersExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Arguments</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        Arguments are the actual values that are passed to a function when it is called. In the add(3, 4) call, 3 and 4
        are arguments that are passed to the add function.
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionArgumentExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Default parameters</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        In Token Programming Language, you can provide default values for function parameters. If an argument is not
        provided when the
        function is called, the default value is used. For example:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionDefaultParamsExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Functions as First-Class
        Citizens</app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        In Token programming language, functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means they can be assigned to
        variables, passed as arguments to other functions, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures
        like arrays or objects.
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionAsFirstClassCitizenExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<div class="title-description-container">
    <app-typography variant='headline4' color="primary" colorShade="500">Closure: </app-typography>
    <app-typography variant="subtitle1">
        A closure is a function that has access to the variables from its containing (enclosing) function's scope, even
        after the containing function has finished executing. Closures are often used to create private variables or
        maintain state. For example:
    </app-typography>
    <app-code-snippet [codeSnippet]="functionClosureExample"></app-code-snippet>
</div>

<app-typography variant="subtitle1">
    In summary, functions are essential building blocks of code in TypeScript, allowing you to encapsulate logic, reuse
    code, and create modular and maintainable software. They can take parameters, have default values, and be
    manipulated as data, making them a versatile and powerful feature of the language.
